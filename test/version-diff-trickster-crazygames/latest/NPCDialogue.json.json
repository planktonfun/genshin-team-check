Make sure not to forget these things I told you.\nIn the bottom left corner of the screen is the chatting window.\nHere you can receive memos, whisper to others, and of course chat.\nThe icons you see on the right side of the bottom of the window indicate categories which are necessary for game play.\nIf you move the mouse over each menu item, a small window will pop up which you can click on to open the interface.\nA letter given in a red color indicates the Shortcut Key that can be used to open the item quickly.\nBasically that's all there is to know about the\\ninterface you see in the game screen, Did it help\\n you?\\nOK then, here's a Quiz and if you get it right, I'll give you a present.\n[[GM_ENI_TryAgainQuestion]]",

Then, open the Item Window and double click on a Item you want to use or drag the item to the Equipment Window. The same principle is applied to installing a Drill, equipping a Pet or wearing fashion items.\nLet me tell you about combat. If you move the mouse near a monster you want to attack, the mouse becomes the shape of a sword. That's when you attack the Monster by clicking it.\nThere are two ways to find out the level of the Monster you're attacking. You can click on the right mouse button over the Monster's head, or you can press \"alt\" key to display the name and level of all monsters nearby the area you're in. You can make good use of the Shortcut Keys if you memorize them. Got it? <<changeNPCState Rosemary Rosemary-1>>\nI need to test you to see if you have followed my tutorial carefully. Let me give you a quest. If you succeed, I promise to reward you. Do you know what happens if you don't succeed?
